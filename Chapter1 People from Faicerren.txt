This was a icy plain, in contrast to a thriving land here grew no trees, grass, nurtured no animals but fish under the sea. Thus was the barren land called Faicerren.
Ice and snow presented everywhere, as much as the perpetual freezing wind. surrounded the unyielding thick glacial ground was the ocean of which uncountable fish dwelled. Nothing other than ice and snow on the surface even when one squinted to the farthest but only a vague figure above the thick ice.

The vague figure soon revealed into fifteen small shadows belonged to fifteen kids wading through slick ice, behind them were innumerable tombs scattered all the way. They breathed out hot air which formed small clouds in front of their emaciated bodies which covered in nothing but showed no signs of suffering in cold. The seemingly eldest child was taking the lead with only 2 sacks of fish leading the others approaching to a place between ice and sea.

They dove into the water as soon as they were in front of water without hesitation.
There was a deep blue sea, so deep that no one could see through its depths. Right underneath the icy surface was a gigantic icy mountain approximately thrice the height of the one on the ground, placed upside down attached to the surface as one single ice. Small fish darted around through crevices of the large ice.
Leading all the kids, the eldest one slithered into one of the crevices so familiar with swimming underwater that the dim sunlight from above casted a glistening sheen upon the skin just like the fish around.

Inside the crevice were caverns, the larger one seemed to serve as attic furnished with icy stones served as tables and chairs, and spears and nets obviously for hunting fish, could hold 50 people, unfortunately only 15 presence. The smaller one was crowded with 15 beds and an empty barrel waiting for fish to fill in. Although the cavern was made of ice, its thickness was sufficient to prevent large fish to come in.

While watching the tiny fish darted around  casually inside the cavern and a dim light diffused from the sunlight through icy ceilings and feeling the water drifted slowly across their bodies, they finally started to repose themselves freely.
In no time the eldest child opened the 2 sack of fish bags ready to share the food. 

(These are the food we only have, it will be tough in the future but there always a way.)
Thinking of the uneasy reality, the eldest child struggled to refrain facial expression in the hope of the others would at least have a nice meal.

They ate their fish raw, all looked with the expression of both relief and despair as if they all know it might be their last meal, however, a slight of resilience still visible from their faces.
They enjoyed their small meal silently, solemnly and continued to remain silent as if waiting for something from the eldest among them.
(It is truly painful to tell them, but they deserve to know it, all will be fine.) 
The eldest one finally decided to put away conscerns and prepared the words.
"Our mas were no more, they had died one by one and will never return to us. The fish we just eaten had been taken from the grave of the last adult whom so kindly to reserved the food for us and died by hunger. Though fret not as we have tools to catch food for ourselves so we can live on. As the eldest and one entrusted by our mas, I will take the lead and we will overcome hardships." said the eldest kid with great courage and determination.
(Actually don't feel confident because mas wouldn't make it themselves, let alone kids of them. But we still have to try the odds.)
With some qualms in the mind, the eldest among the kids decided to rest for a bit after the meal.
